# VoiceWeave

VoiceWeave is an AI-powered grant writing assistant designed to empower mission-driven organizations to craft compelling grant applications that reflect their authentic voice.

## Features

- Interactive demo that simulates AI-enhanced grant application responses
- Sleek, modern UI with a custom color scheme
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Smooth scrolling navigation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm (v8 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ekemper/voiceweave-site.git
cd voiceweave-site
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Development Mode

To run the application in development mode with hot reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the application on http://localhost:5000

### Production Mode

To run the application in production mode, you need to build it first and then start the server:

```bash
# Build and start in one command
./start-prod.sh

# OR run these commands separately
npm run build
npm run start
```

### macOS Users

If you encounter a `ENOTSUP: operation not supported on socket 0.0.0.0:5000` error on macOS, use our macOS-specific script:

```bash
# Build and start the app with localhost binding for macOS
./start-local.sh
```

This alternative script uses 127.0.0.1 (localhost) instead of 0.0.0.0 for the host binding, which is compatible with newer macOS versions.

The build process:
1. Compiles the React front-end using Vite
2. Bundles the server-side code using esbuild
3. Places all compiled files in the `/dist` directory
